## Overview

Minima is built on the philosophy that automation should be as intuitive as manual interaction. By separating human inputs (keyboard and mouse) from the core browser engine, Minima allows developers to build robust scripts that are easy to read, maintain, and scale.


## Project Structure

The repository is organized to ensure a strict separation of concerns and responsibility based on the follow diagram:
